# AIDEX

**AIDEX** (AI and Data Examples) is a collection of compact, practical Python and MATLAB (compatible with the open-source system called Octave) programs that illustrate foundational and advanced concepts in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Each example is self-contained and visual, designed to be useful for education, experimentation, and demonstration. MATLAB/Octave is used when it is important to look at equations; for all else, examples are in Python.

## 📁 Contents

### 🔢 PCA and Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA.m**
  Implements PCA step-by-step in MATLAB without libraries. Shows 3D data, mean-centering, scatter matrix, eigendecomposition, projection onto principal components, and a Pareto plot of explained variance.
- **PCA1.py**  
  Demonstrates PCA on synthetic 3D data with visualization of principal axes in 3D space.
- **PCA2.py**  
  Applies PCA to a 3D bunny mesh using Open3D. Compares original and PCA-aligned point clouds.
- **PCA3.py**  
  Similar to PCA2 but uses a synthetic spherical object to visualize PCA rotation effects.

### 📊 Clustering
- **Cluster1.py**  
  Distance-based clustering with an interactive threshold slider and explanation panel.
- **Cluster2.py**  
  K-Means clustering with an adjustable number of clusters and real-time plot updates.
- **Cluster3.py**  
  Uses silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters dynamically based on overlap, with a standard deviation slider.

### 🧮 Calculus - Interpretation of Derivatives and Minimization
- **Example_A1.py**  
  Animated sigmoid-like function with tangent and derivative speedometer.
- **Example_A2.py**  
  Slider-controlled visualization of function and its derivative, including tangents.
- **Example_A3.py**  
  Combines function, derivative, and polar speedometer in one dashboard.

### 🧠 Gradient Descent and Learning
- **Example_B.py**  
  Visual metaphor of gradient descent as a ball in a well, with step-by-step algebra shown.
- **Example_C.py**  
  Illustrates convergence of a single weight using gradient descent in supervised learning.

### 📈 Adaptive Linear Mapping

- **Example_D.py**  
  High-dimensional matrix learning with sliders to adjust input/output dimensions and iteration count.
